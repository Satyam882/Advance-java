# Advance Java
It is a part of Java programming language. It is an advanced technology or advance version of Java specially designed to develop web-based, network-centric or enterprise applications. It includes the concepts like Servlet, JSP, JDBC, RMI, Socket programming, etc. It is a specialization in specific domain.
# Servlet
Servlet is a technology which is used to create a web application. Â· Servlet is an API that provides many interfaces and classes including documentation
# Life Cycle of a Servlet (Servlet Life Cycle)
- Servlet class is loaded.
- Servlet instance is created.
- init method is invoked.
- service method is invoked.
- destroy method is invoked.
# Servlet interface
Servlet interface provides commonbehaviorto all the servlets.Servlet interface defines methods that all servlets must implement.
# JSP technology 
JSP technology is used to create web application just like Servlet technology. It can be thought of as an extension to Servlet because it provides more functionality than servlet such as expression language, JSTL, etc.

A JSP page consists of HTML tags and JSP tags. The JSP pages are easier to maintain than Servlet because we can separate designing and development. It provides some additional features such as Expression Language, Custom Tags, etc.
 # What is Hibernate used for?
Hibernate is an open source object relational mapping (ORM) tool that provides a framework to map object-oriented domain models to relational databases for web applications. Object relational mapping is based on the containerization of objects and the abstraction that provides that capacity.
# Why Hibernate is used instead of JDBC?
Unlike JDBC, Hibernate allows developers to write their database-driven Java applications using normal, object-oriented semantics
# What is difference between Spring and Hibernate?
Spring is useful for transaction management, aspect-oriented programming, and dependency injection. Hibernate provides Object-Relational Persistence and Query service for applications. Spring has a number of modules such as Spring core, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring JDBC & more.
